# Nest API

Nest is a unique social network API designed with the vision of fostering genuine connections while eliminating toxic elements commonly found in traditional social media platforms. Our mission is to provide a space where users can truly connect with each other without the distractions and negative effects often associated with popular social networking sites.

## Purpose

In today's digital age, social media has become deeply ingrained in our lives. However, many existing platforms prioritize metrics such as likes, comments, and followers, which can often lead to unhealthy behaviors and shallow interactions. Nest aims to challenge this paradigm by offering a platform where users can focus on meaningful connections rather than superficial validation.

## Key Features

- **Toxicity-Free Environment:** Nest removes elements such as likes, comments, and reading checkers to encourage authentic interactions without the pressure of seeking validation or approval.
- **Mindful Engagement:** By removing addictive features and notifications, Nest encourages users to engage with the platform intentionally and mindfully.
- **Connection-Focused:** The app is designed to facilitate genuine connections by emphasizing user profiles, interests, and shared experiences.
